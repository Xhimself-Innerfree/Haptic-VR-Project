// TCP COMMUNICATION
// There is a TCP Client Script in our demo, it can connect to the TCP Server if the two machines are connected to the same WIFI
// (Assets\Scripts_X\TCP_Client_X.cs)
//
// HAPTIC NAVIGATION GUI
// To detect the obstacles around the player and display them with the GUI. This script came out (Assets\Scripts_X\Haptic_GUI_X.cs)
// The obstacle detection module and GUI module are integrated in this script, so it is quite intricate
